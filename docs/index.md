## Welcome to `champ`'s documentation!

#### This documentation is separated into two parts, [**developers**](./developers/setup) and [**operators**](./operators/installation).

The developer documentation is primarily aimed at people who already have development experience and wish to modify, contribute and interact with the project. In contrast, our operator documentation provides a starting point for getting a node up and running, interacting with, securing it, and deployment guidelines.
