## Welcome to `champ`'s documentation!

#### This documentation is seperated into two parts, [**developers**](./developers/setup) and [**operators**](./operators/installation).

The developer documentation is primarily aimed at people who already have development experience and wish to modify, contribute and interact with the project while our operator documentation provides a startingpoint for getting a node up and running and interacting with and securing it.
